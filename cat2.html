    <h3>Making Your Home More Cat Friendly</h3>
    Here, kitty kitty.  Adopting a cat sure can turn you house into a home!  If you’re ready to adopt a feline friend, you may first want to make certain that your home is cat friendly.  By taking a little inventory and double checking your set up, you can make any necessary changes and then rest easy knowing that your new rescued kitty will be safe, comfortable, and happy!  In order to feel secure and get the mental and physical stimulation they need, cats require different things than other pets might, such as for example dogs.  Whereas pups need daily exercise often in the form of walks, with kitties you’ll want to give them playtime indoors.  A good option could be having a climbing tree in your home which offers a great outlet for their clawing and climbing needs.  Click here to read on about how to make your home more cat friendly.  And if you’re up for a fun project, you may want to consider building a catio for your beloved felines to enjoy!

    <div class= "content2"><h3>How to trim your cat’s nails</h3>
    Ideally, cat nail clipping is something you start at very young age, always trying to make it as pleasant an experience as possible – often just doing a nail or two at a time. This gets them used to the sensation, and then as they grow up, they continue not to mind having their nails trimmed. If you’ve adopted an adult cat, and/or if you have never clipped your cat’s claws, you may want to practice holding your cats paws, and extending their nails, before you try using cat clippers. Have your cat lie on your lap as if you were going to clip their claws but instead gently touch their paws. Repeat that over several days. Then try lightly pressing on the bottom of their paw, pushing out the claws while hold the cats paw in your hand. Use one finger on one side of your cat’s toe, and the other on the bottom (on the toe pad), gently squeeze on the toe (or toes) until the claws extend. See photo.

    cat-nail-trimWhen you can accomplish paw holding and nails extension with a relaxed cat, use a pair of sharp nail trimmers and cut off only the tip of the nail. Take care not to damage the vein or quick, which is very painful if cut. See photo for where the quick is located. It is pink and visible on clear or light colored nails. On dark nails, you have to estimate where it will be based on the curve of the cat’s nail. Better to take off too little, than too much!

    If you have never trimmed a cat’s nails before, ask a vet or experienced cat person to show you how the first time. The nail “hook” is what tears up upholstery, so when it is removed, damage is greatly reduced.

    Many cat owners find that using human nail clippers is easier than the ones designed for cats. You may want to try both to see which works best for you!

    For cats that won’t sit still, some cat owners  find trimming just a few nails a day can do that trick – even just one a day while they are sleeping (or sleepy) will eventually get them all done!

    Regular nail trimming as often as every other week will cause the quick to recede, and you can then trim the nails even shorter, for less scratching damage. If you have a cat that goes outside, do not trim their back nails, and consider no or minimal trimming of their front nails, to allow them the maximum chance of success should they need them to escape by climbing a tree, or fighting off an attacker.

    <h3>
    All You Need to Know About Ear Mites in Cats</h3>Ear mites are tiny, crab-like parasites that invade the outer ears and ear canals of cats. There are many different types, but the most common is Otodectes Cynotis, which is found in approximately 90 percent of all feline ear mite infestations.

    <h3>How can I tell if my cat has ear mites?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Excessive scratching of the ears</li>
        <li>Fresh or dried blood inside of the ear canal which may resemble coffee grounds. Small white dots might also be noticed: these are the actual mites. Excessive shaking of the head</li>
        <li>Dizziness and loss of balance</li>
        <li>A lopsided appearance with your cat favoring one ear</li>
        <li>Flattened ears and/or unpleasant odor</li>
    </ul>
    What does a cat ear mite infection look like? In this case a picture really is worth a thousand words. Look for these things:

    Ear mites on cats are not just found in the ears. This parasite can travel all over the cat’s body. Ear mites think other species are tasty too, and they are very contagious. Without treatment, your cat’s ear mite infestation can spread to the family dog, rabbit or hamsters. All family pets have to be treated if mites are found on just one animal. That’s just one more reason why a trip to your local veterinarian or pet health care clinic should be scheduled if you suspect ear mites. Parasites are just one cause of cat otitis (inflammation of the ear). Other causes include allergies, endocrine diseases and tumors. Only a trip to the vet will provide you with a proper diagnosis.
