<p>Will homeless dogs and cats like these have a chance to be seen and find a home? With your help the answer is yes!
More than 200 shelters, humane societies and pet rescue groups are associated with A.R.I.a. , and these 
groups rely on being able to post hundreds of profiles of homeless pets on A.R.I.A.. A dog or cat only has a 
chance to find a home when they are seen, and your gift helps ensure that this happens each and every day - thousands of times a day!
</p>
<br><br>
<p style="font-size:50px">Things You Can Donate:
	<div class="box"><ul>
	<li>Pet food and treats– A lot of the shelter’s money goes towards buying 
	food. Think about how many animals there are to feed there. You can really 
	help them out by bringing in a few cans or bag of food. It goes a long way.
	</li><br>
	<li>Towels and blankets– Shelters are often cold and animals like to have a 
	blanket to curl up on. Towels are a big help to dry animals off after being 
	bathed or if they come in wet. Towels can also be used to line the bottoms of 
	cages. The towels or blankets don’t have to be brand new or in perfect 
	condition. The animals won’t mind., as long as they’re usable.
	</li><br>
	<li>Kitty litter and cat boxes– Cats go to the bathroom- a lot. Shelters are 
	constantly using bag after bag of litter. Their supply runs out fast.
	</li><br>
	<li> Puppy or kitten formula and nursing bottles– Sometimes there are 
	situations where a young puppy or kitten who is not weaned gets separated 
	from their mother. In these situations they need puppy or kitten formula to 
	survive.
	</li><br>
	<li>Old newspaper– When you’re done with your newspapers you usually just 
	throw them away or recycle them, right? You could help animals at no cost to 
	you if you just save up your old newspapers. Newspapers are used in the 
	bottoms of cages. They get soiled quickly, so they’re in constant demand.
	</li><br>
	<li>Collars, harnesses, and leashes– Dogs who are taken out on walks need 
	a leash and collar or harness. The shelter loses some because adopted dogs 
	often go home with their leash or harness.
	</li><br>
	<li>Grooming supplies– Grooming supplies can include shampoo, brushes,
	combs, haircutting scissors, etc.  Dogs and cats often come in dirty or end up 
	getting dirty. Grooming supplies can keep them fresh, clean, and adoptable.
	</li><br>
	<li>Toys– You would get bored if you had to lay in a crate alone all day, wouldn’t 
	you? Animals in shelters get bored, too. It keeps the animals from being so 
	lonely and bored and allows them to get exercise. You could go out and buy new 
	toys, or you could donate toys your pets or children may have not gotten much 
	use out of. It’s as simple as that.
	</li><br>
	<li>Crates and carriers– Animals need to be transported somehow, and the 
	cost of multiple crates and carriers can add up quickly. You can donate ones you 
	stopped using that are still in good condition or you could go buy one for a 
	decent price. This helps the shelter tremendously.
	</li><br>
	<li> Paper towels and cleaning supplies– There are a lot of situations that 
	get messy, so paper towels are a big help.
	</li><br>
	<li>Hand wash and hand sanitizer– People who work at shelters need to 
	keep their hands clean for their and the animals’ health.
	</li><br>
	<li> Laundry detergent, fabric softener, and bleach– Towels and 
	blankets get soiled often so the washing machines are being used a lot.
	</li><br>
	<li>Dog and cat beds and dog houses– this can offer the animals a soft 
	place to lay instead of a kennel or cage floor.
	</li><br>
	<li>Flea and tick treatment– A lot of animals go through the shelters and 
	they often have fleas or ticks.
	</li><br>
	<li> Heating pads– Many animals come in cold or are young and need warmth. 
	Heating pads can replace a mother’s warmth.
	</li><br>
	<li>Copy paper and pens, pencils, post-it notes and staples– You can’t 
	forget about all the paperwork that has to be done. Donating these items makes 
	it so the shelter doesn’t have to buy them on their own.
	</li><br>
	<li>Garbage bags, mops, brooms, and sponges– The shelter uses these 
	every day and clean up supplies can get expensive.
	</li><br>
	<li>Food bowls– As new animals come in, the shelter needs new places to put 
	food. Having an adequate supply could mean life or death for an animal in a 
	shelter.
	</li><br>
	<li> Rubber and latex gloves– A lot of messy stuff happens and gloves are 
	necessary to lessen the spread of germs.
	</li><br>
	<li>Plastic shopping bags– Plastic bags can be used to clean up dog mess 
	and to store things in.
	</li><br>
	</ul>
