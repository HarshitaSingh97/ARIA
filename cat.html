    <h3>Your New Cat or Kitten’s First Day </h3>
    Congratulations! You must be so excited about bringing your newly adopted cat or kitten! I imagine that’s why you’re here, reading this blog article about the 1st day with your new cat (or kitten). Maybe you adopted one already from a shelter, and are just waiting for him (or her!) to get fixed so you can go pick him up and bring him home. Or maybe you’re getting ready to adopt, and what to know what to expect on day one with a new cat or kitten in your home. As a cat and kitten rescue foster volunteer, and an adoptions counselor at a shelter for a decade, I’ve had a lot of both first- and second-hand experience with what it can be like on your new cat’s first day home. Here’s what to expect and how to prepare, so you can be ready to make the first day the best it can be, and get the rest of your life together off to a good start!

    Speaking of getting off to a good start, here’s what you can do to prepare for your new cat or kitten’s 1st day:
    <ol>
        <li>Get basic supplies: a nice big litter box (low sided for kittens), cat litter, cat food, a food dish and a water dish (preferably stainless steel or pet-safe ceramic), toys, scratching post, nail clippers, cat brush, and a cat bed or pillow or blanket.</li>

        <li>Setup starter room. Many cats are very scared in a new environment at first. Starting them out in small starter room, like a small bedroom, big airy bathroom, or other room with a door you can close, will help them get used to a smaller space first. Put all their supplies in the room. Set up the litter box with litter in it according to the litter label’s instructions. Check to make sure windows any any other possible escape routes (like loose vent grills) are securely closed. Unplug or securely tape down any electrical cords, and remove any small ingestible or breakable objects — pretend like you are childproofing for a 2 year old human!</li>

        <li>Bring the new cat home! When you bring your new cat home, close any other pets (and humans!) in a separate room, and carry your new cat into the starter room while he’s still in his cat carrier. Set the carrier down, and open the carrier’s door. Allow the cat to come out (or not) at his own speed. Leave the carrier in the room with him if he wants to hide in it.</li>

        <li>Take it slow. Some cats will be walking around wanting to explore right away on the first day. But more typically, cats will take 1-2 days to a couple of weeks to adjust to a new home. This is totally normal!  You do want to make sure they are eating and using the litter box daily, even if they are hiding. With a fresh-from-spay or neuter cat follow your vet’s instructions on monitoring their behavior and health. If you can, avoid friends or other pets meeting your new cat until he is relaxed and happy in his new home. </li>
    
    </ol>

    <h3>How to Give a Cat a Bath? </h3>
    One would think that any creature that can so beautifully emulate the flow of water would not harbor such a longstanding hatred and fear of it. The fact is, most domestic cats do not enjoy getting wet. Some will even lift their noses at the thought of walking over a damp floor. The information in this article will help you prepare for giving your pet a bath. It may not be a joyful experience for all involved, but it will be relatively quick and painless.

    <h3>Fast Cat Fact:</h3>
    In the wild, there are many species of big cats that actually enjoy the water. Tigers and jaguars like to soak in water, most likely because their usual habitat is in a hot environment and it helps keep them cool. Tigers will actually swim in deep water and they have been observed catching fish.
    Domestic cats may have evolved to dislike water because most breeds have coats that absorb rather than deflect moisture. It’s harder for them to get dry after they’re soaked.
    
    <h3>Why Would A Cat Need A Bath?</h3>
    In most cases, a cat would not need to be washed with water. Cats groom themselves naturally, so regular brushing is usually enough to keep your pet looking clean and comfortable. However there are occasions when a real bath is necessary. They may have soiled themselves in the litter box. Cats have been known to try to climb up the inside of a chimney. Perhaps you’ve just adopted a new cat and it is home from the animal shelter for the first time. Sometimes cats will also need bathing with flea or fungicidal medications.
    
    <h3>How Should I Prepare To Give My Cat A Bath? </h3>
    Too bad you can’t sit little Cleo down in front of the TV to see how much tigers love the water on the National Geographic channel. That won’t work, not all cats are fans of television. They love the Internet though, but unfortunately many of the animal videos on the web show cats that can’t stand having a bath!
    The best solution is to make sure that you have all the necessary supplies handy, so you can make your cat’s bath very quick:
    <ul>
        <li>Rubber gloves (even the most placid feline may scratch during a bath)</li>
        <li>Cat shampoo (various brands available at pet stores or supermarkets)</li>
        <li>A large pitcher for rinsing or (even better) a gentle spray nozzle</li>
        <li>A large towel</li>
        <li>Cotton balls to clean the ears</li>
        <li>A small cloth to clean the face</li>
    </ul>
    
    It’s much easier to wash your cat in a kitchen or bathroom sink than bending over a bathtub. Following is a step-by-step procedure for the quick and painless cat bath:
    <ol>
        <li>Fill the sink with about 2 or 3 inches of lukewarm water</li>
        <li>Wet the cat from the shoulders to the tail and apply shampoo.</li>
        <li>Just like your own hair, lather and rinse thoroughly</li>
        <li>Since most cats really hate having water splashed on their face, use a damp washcloth to gently clean your cat’s head.</li>
        <li>Use a cotton ball to clean inside the cat’s ears. Never put any kind of object (not even a Q-Tip) in your cat’s ear.</li>
    </ol>
