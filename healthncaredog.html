            Getting ready to adopt a new puppy? These basic training, socialization, and guidelines can be used starting at the age of 8 weeks, 
	        the earliest age at which most people would be bringing a puppy into their home. If your puppy is slightly older, as long as they are 
	        under 6 months old, these steps can still be followed.
	 
	         <h3>Prepare for puppy's arrival: </h3>
             Being prepared can mean the difference between getting a good start, or getting started off on the wrong paw. A puppy needs a safe, 
			  warm environment. Being raised indoors with as much human contact as possible is critical at this stage.

			 <h3>Puppy-proof a play area:</h3>
			 Puppies will chew everything, from electrical wires to socks and shoes. You need a secure, puppy-proof, enclosed area and a crate for 
			 those times you cannot directly supervise your puppy. Puppies typically are not housebroken, and should be kept in an area when it is 
			 ok to have accidents.
			 
			 <h3>Establish a daily routine from day one:</h3> 
			 A puppy feels secure having dinner, playtime, lessons and walks at the same time each day. Also, being left alone all day on Monday 
			 after having spent his entire first weekend with you can cause lots of anxiety. If you do bring him home on a weekend, leave him alone 
			 for progressively longer periods of time. Schedule your puppy’s feedings so that all meals are fed by 5-6 pm (if you go to bed at 11), 
			 and so your puppy drinks very little water after that. Be regular about you and your puppy’s bedtime and time getting up in the morning 
			 to help your puppy learn to hold it through the night.<br><br>

            <h2>How to give a dog a bath</h2>
            <p>Giving a dog a bath can be fun – or a challenge! You might not expect it, but even the most untrained dogs will often be really good when 
                you give them a bath. Dogs can understand you’re helping them get clean, and most appreciate it! If you are an experienced dog bather, you might think a whole blog article about how to give a dog a bath is a little silly! But for a dog bath newbie, knowing what to expect and how to prepare for the experience can make it less intimidating the first time, and soon they’ll be an expert dog bath giver too. Here are a few simple steps so your dog washing event is smooth sailing for both you and your pup.
            </p>


            <ul>
                <li>Bath location:</li>
                <p>Decide where you are going to give the bath. If you’re in an apartment or don’t have a yard, it will likely be in your bathtub or shower. 
                Kitchen sinks can work for a very tiny (under 10 pound) dog, if you have a nice flat big kitchen sink, with a faucet you can move totally out of 
                the way. Even if you have a yard, giving a dog a bath with cold water from a hose isn’t much fun for either of you, except on the hottest days. 
                But it is often the only option for a dog that is too big for you to pick up if you only have a tub. You can’t expect a big dog to jump into 
                the tub.</p>


                <li>Bath supplies:</li>
                    <ul >
                        <li>Dog brush</li>
                        <li>Dog-safe shampoo</li>
                        <li>Dog-safe conditioner (optional)</li>
                        <li>Towels</li>
                        <li>A shower nozzle, or a plastic bowl or big cup, to scoop up water out of the tub for wetting and rinsing.</li>
                    </ul>
                <br>

                <li>Shower nozzle:</li>
                <p>If you are going to be bathing your dog at home regularly, having a spray nozzle on the end of a hose attached to your faucet, so you can spray 
                your dog with exactly the right temperature water to wet and rinse them, makes bath time so much easier.
                </p>		

                <li>Find a helper:</li> 
                <p>Having someone to hold the dog while you bathe them so they don’t jump out of the tub is ideal. If you can’t find a helper, bathe them wearing 
                their harness or leash, so you have more control – you will be bathing them one handed that way though, so it does take a bit longer.</p>

                <li>Steps to give your dog a bath in the tub:</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Brush your dog. If your dog has longer hair, make sure it is tangle-free. Matts will become impossible to brush out once they’ve become wet.</li>
                        <li>Set the shower or tub’s water temperature to warm – not hotAbout as warm as you’d have for a human baby. If you don’t have a nozzle spray, fill the tub up to six inches at most, even for a big dog. More water usually just means more mess. You also don’t want your dog to feel like they have to swim, so have the water level be low enough so it’s not touching their belly when they are standing in it.</li>
                        <li>Make sure you have all your supplies in the bathroom. Bring your dog into the bathroom and close the door. Pick up your dog and put them in the water. Lots of praise telling them how good they are being.</li>

                        <li>Using the spray nozzle or the plastic cup, wet their fur all over. Do not get water in their ears or eyes – just use your wet hands to wet the fur on their ears and face, don’t pour water over their head.</li>

                        <li>Shampoo: Put a tiny amount of dog shampoo in your hand. Starting with less is better, so you don’t have to do too much rinsing. Lather up starting at their tail. You can often push the shampoo foam through their fur so you don’t need to use as much. To clean their ears and face, wipe your barely-soapy hand over the outside of their ears (never inside) and their face avoiding the eyes by a wide margin.</li>

                        <li>Rinse: Thoroughly rinse off all the shampoo using the nozzle spray or scooping water from the bottom of the tub.</li>

                        <li>Dry: Lift them out of the tub, and towel them off. You’re all done, you have a clean dog. Now all you have to do is clean the tub </li>
                    </ol>
            </ul>

            <p>Dogs really don’t like the noise of a blow dryer. But if your dog is older, is a puppy, or otherwise susceptible to getting chilled and your house 
            is cool, you may want to dry them with a hair dryer, set to medium (not hot) and blown from about 2 feet away from their fur while running your hand 
            over the fur at the same time, so you make sure its not getting too warm. You can also engage them in some active play to get their internal body 
            temperature up.</p>
