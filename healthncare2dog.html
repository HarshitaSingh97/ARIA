		Happily, housetraining your new dog or puppy can take patience and time, but it is usually not complicated! We have lots of experience from 
		housetraining many foster dogs and puppies, and helping new adopters to easily and kindly train their new canine family member to take care of 
		‘business’ in the appropriate potty spot. We prefer the term “housetraining” to “housebreaking” because you really are training your puppy or dog 
		to go where you want – hopefully without having to break any bad habits! Here are the basic steps to housetraining your dog or puppy:
		
		<ol>
		<li>SUPERVISE</li>
		<p>Keep your dog under constant supervision while inside – if you must take your eyes away even for a second, confine your dog either in a crate, 
		or in a room with a hard-surfaced floor where accidents may be easily cleaned up, or outside in a secure area. With some dogs and in some homes its
		best to “tether” them to you, keeping them on a leash attached to you at all times. Close doors or block off carpeted rooms and rooms with rugs that 
		can’t be taken up.</p>

		<li>PICK A SPOT</li>
		<p>It is easiest for a dog to learn to go in one specific spot, rather than just outside. Pick a “potty” spot, be it in your yard, a grassy area out 
		front, or a corner of your patio. Most dogs prefer porous surfaces (dirt/grass/gravel/carpet/newspaper) if you have a bit of what the dog has gone on 
		before, you can place it where you want the dog to go.</p>

		<li>MAKE A ROUTINE</li>
		<p>In the beginning, the more often you go to the potty spot, the better you chances of success. Put your dog and yourself on a firm daily schedule 
		of sleeping, feeding and play/exercise, and your dog will start to go to the bathroom on a schedule. And you can make sure he’s at the right spot 
		when the time comes. A typical schedule would include going to the potty spot first thing when you wake up, after breakfast, then at set intervals 
		throughout the day. Two hours apart is great. Longer times will work, it will just take longer for your dog to learn to physically be able to hold it 
		for longer periods. Take your dog to his potty spot at the times you’ve set and wait (on a leash is often best). Allow the dog to circle and sniff, 
		but don’t encourage him to play…this is serious business time! Be patient and wait for at least five minutes. If he starts to relieve himself, praise 
		quietly until he is finished, then praise him very enthusiastically and reward him with a game or food treat. If he doesn’t go, it’s back to supervision 
		until the next set time. Continue with the routine, and once he’s going when you take him out, gradually increase the time between visits to the potty 
		spot. When you’re down to three times a day and no more accidents inside (anywhere from two to six weeks), you’ve housetrained your dog.</p>

		<li>LEARN THE COMMAND</li>
		<p>A phrase like “Get Busy” or “Go Potty” can really help your dog to understand when and where to go the bathroom. Use it just like you use any verbal
		command – like “Sit,” you say it before you want your dog to do it, and then if he does, give him lots of praise and treats. It won’t work to say it 
		too many times in a row (two or three is enough), and should be said in a happy tone of voice, never as a punishment. Also, if you catch your dog in 
		the act of “getting busy” in the correct spot, you can say “Get busy!! Good dog! Get busy! Good good!!” so they associate that phrase with what they 
		are doing.</p>

		<li>REWARD</li>
		<p>If you see your dog about to go, or in the middle of relieving himself indoors, you can say ‘NO’ firmly, but do not raise your voice or yell. Then, 
		immediately take him to your chosen place outside and reward him – praise, treats or play, which ever he most enjoys. Although he has done nothing to 
		be praised for, it is essential that he associate going to that place with reward. If you have caught him in time he will still need to go. If he does 
		go, lots of praise and rewards.</p>

		<li>PUNISHMENT?</li>
		<p>The worst thing you can do is punish your dog for ‘accidents’ that you discover after the fact. Dogs cannot make a connection with punishment for 
		something they did in the past. Some owners will say, “Oh, but he knows he has done wrong because if I show him the mess he looks guilty.” The dog has
		simply learned that if humans are present and there is a mess on the floor, he is likely to be told off or punished, and yes he will cringe or cower 
		down if you yell. He has not learned not to make the association – and not to make the mess in the first place.
            </p>

		<p>Also, yelling, making a loud noise with pennies in a can, swatting your dog with a newspaper, pushing your dog’s nose in his mess aside from being 
		inhumane, they often have the effect of making the dog afraid of you… or afraid of going in front of you. Then, housebreaking will take even longer, 
		or may never happen. This is usually what has happened to dogs that go in the house only when left alone, or in a back room when you aren’t watching. 
		Positive reinforcement is the fastest, easiest way to train. Punishment is the slowest and least-pleasant way to get a dog to do what you want, and 
		often doesn’t work at all, especially for housebreaking.</p>

		<li>CLEAN</li>
		<p>When or if your pooch has an accident inside your home, thoroughly clean by using biological washing powder solution or a specially formulated 
		enzyme product to remove all traces of the smell. If possible, keep your dog away from these areas until the training is complete. If they keep going 
		on the same spot, put a tarp-covered chair or other pee-proof object in front of or on top of that spot – or lock them out of that room until they are
		solidly housetrained.</p>
		</ol>

		<p>These steps do work quickly for most dogs. However, some dogs or puppies, like those from pet stores and puppymills (where they are forced to go to
		the bathroom in the same tiny space where they sleep and eat) can be more of a challenge. If your dog is more than 8 months old, and after a month of 
		following these steps you are still having accidents, please consult a professional trainer for assistance. Other reasons why your dog has accidents 
		in the house may include: stress and tension in the household, anxiety (for example, about being left alone or changes in routine), illness and 
		submissive urination. Before beginning any training program, a clean bill of health from your dog’s veterinarian is advised.</p>

		<p>Sometimes it feels like it’s taking ‘forever’ and some dogs will make progress and then take a few steps back, but this positive-reinforcement 
		housebreaking method has worked time and time again for many dogs around the world, and it can work for yours, too!</p>

		<div class= "dog4"><h2> Teach your dog not to jump up on people</h2>
		It’s natural for a puppy to jump up on other dogs to say hi, and some dogs might be trying to make themselves taller than another dog to show a 
		higher status in the social pack. Dogs may jump on people either as a friendly greeting, or when trying to establish dominance too. Many people think
		this is cute when the dogs are small or a puppy, but for dogs that are (or will be) medium-sized or large, teaching them not to jump up on people can 
		prevent small children, seniors, and less dog-savvy people from getting hurt or scared. It helps a dog understand that people have different rules 
		than other dogs – it’s good doggie manners. With your newly adopted dog or puppy, here are some simple tips to train Miss Jumping Jellybean not to 
		jump up on people:
		
            <ul>
			<li>Turn away and ignore</li>
			<li>Be still & quiet</li>
			<li>Don’t look</li>
			<li>No contact</li>
		</ul>
